# RoadWatch-Crowdsourced-Road-Condition-Reporting-System
RoadWatch is a smart civic-tech platform that allows citizens to report potholes and damaged roads in real time using photos and GPS location.
The system visualizes reported issues on a live map and provides an admin dashboard for authorities to prioritize repairs based on severity and location.
This solution helps reduce road accidents, improves infrastructure maintenance, and supports smart city initiatives through community participation.
